    <h2>Halifax - Townsville</h2>
      <p>Mount Halifax is a challenging experience with an extremely high reward if you dare decide to camp up the top. 
        Containing one of the most beautiful sunrises I’ve witnessed in the greater Townsville Region thanks to an admittedly 
        lackluster night’s sleep up the top. Halifax is 1km in Elevation and is not recommended without a decent level of fitness. 
        After a 3-5hr ascent, you will find a good clearing for setting up camp if you came prepared to do so.
      </p>

      <br><br>
      <p>Along the way there will be several spots to stop, including Rope Falls which comes as a highly recommended spot 
        for a swim on the way down to help muscle recovery and generally cooling down. The thick tree cover and high humidity 
        can result in quite the large amount of sweat being produced, as such it is highly recommended to carry at least 2.5L 
        of water for a single day round-trip.</p>

        <div class="col-md-7 my-auto"><p>Getting up isn't the only challenge, getting down can also be quite difficult due to the often
          slippery and always steep terrain. Make sure to take your time down and rest where needed, as while you likely won't be puffing,
          your quads will begin to falter due to the constant strain over several ours.
