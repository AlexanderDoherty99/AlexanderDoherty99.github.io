      <h2>Cradle Mountain - Tasmania</h2>
      <p>Cradle Mountain is an absolutely beautiful and semi-challenging hike for the able bodied to experience! 
          Containing a satisfying fake-summit before a long and mostly flat journey toward the base of Cradle Mountain itself. 
          Find pockets of snow in the summer and a landscape of snow in the winter on the way, 
          reach the top for an amazing view while trying to not get blown of the mountain!</p>

      <br><br>
      <p>But what exactly can you expect if you decide to venture out to Top this beauty of a mountain? 
        Starting off you’ll need to purchase a Tasmania “Parks Pass” to gain easy access to the area.</p>

        <div class="col-md-5"><img src="../images/20211202_093519_NEILIN.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Sprawling landscape with a board."></div>
        <div class="col-md-7 my-auto"><p>After taking a short bus ride from the visitor’s centre, 
          you’ll arrive at one of the several starting points on your Journey, keep along the wooden path, 
          and I promise things will get more interesting.</p></div>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>During the Journey you’ll likely encounter several Wombats and other native wildlife, 
        bringing a camera along for this journey would not be a mistake, provided you are willing to carry it a 
        long distance and up the later rugged terrain. Eventually you will reach the a natural stopping point at what 
        feels much like a false summit with a sprawling landscape both down in the accompanying valley and also on the 
        same level as the summit, signaling that your journey is far from over. At this point beware, the wind can pickup 
        to drastically higher speeds than you may be expecting.</p>
      <br>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-7 my-auto"><p>A vast landscape with the true summit in the distance as you truly realize you’ve got a long way to go. </p></div>

      </div>
      <br>
      <p>After a lot of flatter walking, once again reacquainting you with a wooden path, 
        you will finally come to what feels like the true base of Cradle Mountain. Now is the time to put away 
        your valuables and get ready to do some climbing. The path will begin to disappear and be replaced by 
        boulders and rocks that must be overcome, each leading you closer to the top.</p>
